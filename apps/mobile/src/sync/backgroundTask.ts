/** Best-effort while-backgrounded freshness: WorkManager's 15-minute floor, further throttled by Doze and
 *  app-standby buckets — in practice hours, not minutes. Foreground triggers remain the real freshness path;
 *  this keeps the mirror from going stale over a long idle stretch.
 *
 *  runSync kicks the camera-roll backup as its last step, so a background tick also drains a few queued
 *  assets. That makes background backup catch-up, NOT a Google-Photos-grade instant upload: the task's
 *  ~30 s budget fits a handful of photos, and a video may need several ticks (each retry resumes from the
 *  queue, so no work is lost). Bulk backup happens while the app is open. */
